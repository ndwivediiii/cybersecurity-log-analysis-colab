# Cybersecurity Log Analysis using Google Colab

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates beginner-level cybersecurity skills by analyzing simulated user access logs using Python in Google Colab. The objective is to identify suspicious login behavior and apply Identity and Access Management (IAM) and Security Operations Center (SOC) concepts.

## Tools Used
- Google Colab
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)
- GitHub

## Key Activities
- Created simulated user access logs
- Identified failed and abnormal login attempts
- Applied IAM concepts such as role-based access control
- Visualized security events
- Documented findings and security recommendations

## Findings
- Admin account login attempts from unknown locations
- Failed logins during non-business hours
- Limited access for Analyst and Intern roles

## Recommendations
- Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Restrict access by location and time
- Continuous monitoring using SIEM tools

## Skills Demonstrated
Cybersecurity fundamentals, IAM, SOC basics, log analysis, Python, data visualization
